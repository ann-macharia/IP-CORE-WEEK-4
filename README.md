An electric car company (AUTOLIB) has provided a data set on the electric cars and their stations.The provided dataset is a daily aggregation, by date and postal code, of the number of events on the Autolib network.

Autolib is an electric car sharing company. the company has 3 main types of electric cars: blue cars, utilib counter and the utilib 4 counter. these cars operate in the city of Paris.

There has been several discussions on when there is highest activity of the blue car, whether it is in the morning hours or the afternoon hours. The company has tasked me to do an investigation toclearly know at what times usage is greater. This will mostly help in planning the marketing strategies and segmentation
